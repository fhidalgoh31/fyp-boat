Decision
========

Easiest: Bilge Pump
------------------
The easiest option here is using a small bilge pump. These are designed to be submerged un seawater, and have been shown to work as thrusters. The only downside of taking one of these is that it is unknown if they can be run backwards (very quick investigations say no).
The other risk here is that these motors may not be very easy to regulate (with the only regulation option being avaliable power, no speed feedback).

The lack of reverse may not be an issue, assuming we do not need to do precise station keeping (or have to do a standing/sharp turn)

Second: OpenROV motors
---------------------
The OpenROV motors are not sealed, so they will either need to be treated to withstand constant immersion in a saline enviroment, or we hope that constant immersion won't cause issues. These have the large upside of being fully regulatable DC motors (so they can be reversed and have a controllable speed). The problem here is that our constant driving power is quite a bit below their max power rating (and is around their zero-load power drain).

Third: Just use a BlueRobotics thruster
-------------------
Since the OpenROV motors are so overpowered (compared to our power capacity), we could just got for the BlueRobotics thrusters (already used on one of the AUVs), and run them at the peak efficiency point.

Fourth: Internal motor connected via a shaft seal
--------------------------
Complex, but allows using a fully-featured and well-sized motor without caring about getting it wet. Problem may be finding a suitably sized seal for the motor shaft. (Shrink-wrap spacers could be used to pad out the shaft so it fits the seal, or a larger shaft could be attached).


Calculations
============

Thrust
------

Most recent drag calculation is _41N_ (at an unknown velocity, likely 1.3m/s)

Effective thrust is calculated by multiplying the shaft RPM by the advance of the propellor (and reducing to account for compression, rotation, and edge losses)
- Prop advance: 18mm run, ~110 degrees, ~25mm blade length (assume flat, it isn't)
 - Pitch is the distance the prop would move if the fluid were non-compressable
 - P ~= C / W * L => P = 360 / 110 * 18mm = ~58mm pitch
 - P * Area of blades ~= volume of moved water
 - `58mm * (2 * pi * 57^2 - 2 * pi * 6^2)` (6mm hub assumed)
  - `1.17e6` mm^3 per revolution (1.171 l/rev)

### DST-700 (OpenRov)
- Test data from [https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-dst-700-brushless-outrunner-motor-700kv.html](HobbyKing)
 - 0.82kgf (8N) thrust at 130W
 - Assume linear (bad assumption), max thrust at ~5W draw would be 0.31N

### BlueRobotics
- T200 has peak efficiency at 1570us, 0.51lbf (2.26N) thrust at 5.51W draw.
 - Required draw for overcoming above drag is 79W ea (1770us)

### FIT0441
- 159RPM, using above calc that's about 186l/min moved at max speed (assuming no slip and no loss)
 - 

### Bilge Pump ("Rule" 25D)
- Numbers from [http://store.waterpumpsupply.com/runo12vodcbi.html](Extra stats)
 - 6.7' head height can deliver 180GPH at 12V
 - 2.04m at 0.19l/s
 - 2.04m of water assuming the pipe diameter constant at 1.9cm gives a volume of 4.6 liters (~4.6 kg)
 - 4.6kgf (45N) at max power 1.9A/12V
 - Assuming linear relation of power to thrust, at ~5W we'd get 9.8N thrust per motor
