\subsection{Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item 100W solar supply
\item Survive a whole day with no solar generation
\item Able to drive continiously
\item Routine telemetry updates via Satellite modem
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Generation Capacity}
Main power is to be supplied by a ~1.5x1m solar panel (see below), this size of panel is rated to about 100W generation capacity. In Perth, there's an approximate factor of 4.3 to go from a panel's rated power output to the daily generation capacity (in W-h), however this factor is calcualted based on using an optimal panel angle. Since the panel will be (on average) flat, the factor will be reduced to about 85\% \ref{solarcalc_angle}.

This avaliable generation capacity must be sufficient to both power the boat during the day, and provide charging for during the night (and cloudy days). This requires that a minium of 50\% of the supply power must be reserved for charging (and ideally up to 70\% to account for losses and recharging after cloudy days).

$$
P_{\text{cont}} = 100 \times 4.3 \times 0.88 \times 0.70 \div 24 \approx 11W
$$

\paragraph{Power Storage}
To be able to continue to run at full capacity in the absense of solar generation for a whole day, we need storage equivalent to 36 hours of continual drain.
$$
E_{\text{storage}} = 11W \times 36\text{hrs} \approx 400\text{W-h} = 33\text{A-hr at 12V}
$$

\subsection{Existing Parts}

\paragraph{Controller: ArduPilot2.8 Controller Board}

\paragraph{Modem: RockBlock+ Satellite Modem}

\subsection{New Parts}

\paragraph{Battery}
Any 40A-hr 12V lead-acid battery will work, but using two batteries may be desirable to ensure a sane weight distribution.

\section{Firmware}
Firmware will be the \texttt{APMrover2} configuration of the open-source ArduPilot suite. However, to support telemetry updates via the Satellite modem, there will need to changes to the stock firmware.
